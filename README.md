# an implementation of sha512 in rust

this is an implementation of the famous sha512 hashing algorithim that I implementated for fun (and because some one challenged me to do it)

you can run the program to get the checksum of a file by typing in the command line

`cargo run <filename>` 

and there are test cases you can run by typing

`cargo test`

### IMPORTANT
do not use this code in a serious application, this was writen for fun and it is possible for it to be filled with security bugs
there are many cryptography libraries you can use for your project (the first that comes to mind is openssl)

use this at your own risk
